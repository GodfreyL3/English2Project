                        The world we live in today is engulfed in technology, and it's hard to imagine a functioning world today without it. We can request data anywhere in the world. We can communicate with others across the globe. We can perform many calculations that would take a group of people years, in less than a second. However this begs the question: How exactly does technology shape our lives today? With how deeply incorporated technology is to human life, it's almost impossible to deny the effects it has on us.

                    <p>Technology in recent years has affected the mental health of many people around the world. Given its strong ties with society today it's quite easy to become
                        "overly connected". This has resulted in issues such as narcissism, distraction, and even depression. But what's the full picture?</p>

                    <p>Our physical bodies have adapted and changed due to the heavy usage of technology within the recent years. From something as simple as dry eyes, to growing "horns" on your neck, there is no doubt that technology has
                        played a role in the makeup of the human body.</p>
