                    <h4>Buisness Market</h4>
                    <p> Technology was built for making human lives easier and more efficient (most of the time). Therefore, it's not surprising to see it now so deeply incorporated into society. An example would be how the business industry is now becoming so much more efficient, due to the unimportance of distance. Writer Robert Lee Bonsbruck in his Article <a class="ref" href="https://www.zurich.ibm.com/pdf/news/Konsbruck.pdf">Impacts of Information Technology on Society in the new Century</a> explains that communication systems involved in online marketplaces and e-commerce has made business much more efficient by eliminating the “intermediaries” such as clerks and stockbrokers, who carry information from place to place. “The result is disintermediation throughout the distribution channel, with cost reduction, lower end-consumer prices, and higher profit margins”, says Bonsbruck. This new way of doing business "enlarges existing markets" by making products so accessible, and companies now must find clever and innovative ways to advertise if they want to compete on an online marketplace.

                    <h4>Education</h4>
                    <p> Technology though, has even revolutionized the way education systems are set up. Before technology, education was a sort of luxury, where only the elite or wealthy had access to education. Even if that wasn’t the case, people would have to travel to learning centers to access information. Now, with technology’s influence, we’re able to have an incredible amount of access to information to pursue the field we desire. A perfect example would be online classes. Though it is impossible to simulate the effect of being in a classroom perfectly by interacting and working with others, these online classes benefit those who have busy lifestyles, who cannot fit time into their day to travel and sit down in a class. The flexibility of online training and classes makes it more accessible for many people.</p>

                    <h4>Social Life</h4>
                    <p>There is no doubt that, when used in a responsible way, technology has bought more people together. It allows people to connect to each other from almost anywhere, and improve social participation. It also has been proven that people who are connected onto some sort of online network, have more significant ties than a person who doesn't utilize technology and the internet. "With the help of the internet, people are able to maintain active contact with sizable social networks, even though many of the people in those networks do not live nearby" says researchers from the <a class="ref" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2006/01/25/the-strength-of-internet-ties/">Pew Research Center</a>. Online and social media aren't beneficial as a replacement for physical interaction however, and should be used more as a supplement to help communicate to people they care about.
